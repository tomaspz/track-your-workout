* [Expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) a Nodejs npm package that allows to create a very robust web server that handles routes in the backend.
* [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/), also known as npm, which allows to install packages in the Nodejs environment and expand Nodejs' capabilities. 
* [MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/), which is [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL), or non-relational, or distributed database.It is powerful in maintaining data as collection of documents.
* [MongoJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongojs) is a module for mongodb, that emulates the official mongodb API as much as possible.
* [Mongoose schema](http://mongoosejs.com/), which is an [ODM (Object Document Mapper)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/phalcon/phalcon_object_document_mapper.htm) that  maps objects with a Document Database like Mongo. 
* [Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo)](https://robomongo.org/download), a free, lightweight, open-source MongoDB GUI with an embedded mongo shell, real auto-completion, and support for asynchronous operations.
